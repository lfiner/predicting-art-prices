# Predicting the prices of contemporary art
Larry Finer  
February 2019

The goal of this project was to predict the prices of contemporary artworks on [Artspace](https://artspace.com), an online marketplace for art, using characteristics of the artwork and artist. The project entailed scraping and downloading artist and artwork data, cleaning the data, and then developing a linear regression model through feature engineering, adding polynomial features, and testing regularization approaches.

The [Jupyter Notebook file](Pricing%20contemporary%20art.ipynb) above contains the code to carry out these steps.
